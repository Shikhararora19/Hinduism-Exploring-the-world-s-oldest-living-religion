	<h2>Social Justice in Hinduism</h2>
	<p>Hinduism, a religion that has been influential in forming South Asia's cultural, social, and political landscape for thousands of years, places a high priority on social justice.</p>
	<p>Hinduism has a strong dedication to social justice and equality, which is reflected in its teachings on topics like caste, gender, and environmentalism.</p>
	<p>Hinduism's emphasis on the concept of dharma, or obligation, is one of its greatest contributions to social justice. According to Hindu philosophy, it is everyone's responsibility to play their individual role in society to the best of their abilities. This concept of duty encompasses all facets of life, such as social and environmental obligations.</p>
	<p>While the concept of social justice is not explicitly mentioned in the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad Gita, the Hindu scriptures do contain numerous references to the importance of social justice and the need to treat all people equally.</p>
	<p>For example, the Bhagavad Gita states that all people are equal in the eyes of God, and the Upanishads state that all people are equal in the eyes of the universe. The Hindu scriptures also emphasise the importance of treating all people with respect and dignity, regardless of their social status or economic background.</p>
	
	<section>
		<h3>Caste</h3>
		<img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cZUMhcs5Ij0/W7n2gQlkslI/AAAAAAAAK34/9vaHaQnR6wIZ8MZ5wK8OmR8wugMWEgCigCLcBGAs/s1600/Caste%2BSystem.jpg" width="300" height="200"> 
		<p>Caste, which has historically led to injustice and prejudice in South Asian civilizations, and Hinduism have a complicated relationship. Even though the caste system is not based on any particular religious theory, many Hindus have fought to oppose it because of how oppressive it is. Hindu reformers like Jyotirao Phule and B.R. Ambedkar were instrumental in the struggle against caste prejudice and the uplift of underprivileged groups.</p>
		<p>While the caste system is not a part of Hinduism, it is a part of Hindu culture. The caste system is a social hierarchy that divides people into four main groups: Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. The Brahmins are the highest caste, and they are considered to be the most intelligent and spiritually advanced. The Shudras are the lowest caste, and they are considered to be the least intelligent and spiritually advanced.</p>

	<section>
		<h3>Gender Equality</h3>
		<p>Along with caste, Hinduism has contributed to the advancement of gender equality. Hindu teachings place a strong emphasis on the value of respect and equality for both men and women, notwithstanding the patriarchal nature of traditional Hindu culture. Hindu goddesses like Kali and Durga are potent representations of the strength and empowerment of women. From the Rani of Jhansi, who fought against British colonialism, to contemporary activist Vandana Shiva, who promotes women's rights and sustainable agriculture, Hindu women have also played significant roles in social justice movements.</p>
		
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Environmentalism</h3>
		<p>Hinduism has also contributed to the advancement of environmentalism. The Hindu scriptures contain numerous references to the importance of protecting the environment and preserving natural resources. The Vedas, for example, state that the earth is a sacred place that must be protected and respected. The Bhagavad Gita also states that the earth is a sacred place that must be protected and respected.</p>
		<p>Many Hindus have also been instrumental in the advancement of environmentalism. Mahatma Gandhi, for example, was a strong advocate for environmentalism and the preservation of natural resources.</p>
		<p>The interconnection of all living things and the importance of environmental preservation are stressed in Hindu teachings. Ahimsa, or non-violence, is a concept that includes not only people but also animals and the natural environment. Hindu teachings on environmental stewardship served as the foundation for the grassroots environmental movement known as the Chipko, which had its start in the 1970s and was spearheaded by women in rural Uttarakhand.</p>
