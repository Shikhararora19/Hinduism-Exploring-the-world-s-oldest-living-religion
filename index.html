			<h2>Hindu Practices</h2>
			<p>Hinduism is a lively, multifaceted religion that embraces a broad spectrum of customs and principles. Hinduism isn't defined by a single set of beliefs or rituals, but there are a number of essential practises that are universally followed in all parts of the world. These customs demonstrate the close relationship between Hinduism and the natural world and have their roots in the rich cultural and spiritual traditions of the Indian subcontinent.</p>

				<h3>Puja</h3>
				<img src="https://jloog.com/images/hindu-clipart-ganesh-chaturthi-14.jpg" width="300" height="200">
				<p>Millions of Hindus worldwide do pujas, which are an essential component of Hindu religion. The Sanskrit word "pj," which meaning "to worship" or "to revere," is where the word "puja" originates. Puja is a cultural practise that deepens the bond between the worshipper and the almighty in addition to being a religious ceremony.
				A person or group of people will typically hold a puja if they want to connect with a particular deity or ask for their blessings for a specific goal. It entails praying to the deity and giving him or her gifts like flowers, fruits, and other things. It could also entail lighting candles or incense. Additionally, the worshipper may chant mantras or prayers, which are said to have strong spiritual effects.</p>
				<p>Pujas come in a wide variety of forms, each with its own set of rituals and traditions. For instance, during Diwali, the festival of lights, candles are lit and prayers are offered to the goddess Lakshmi, while during Holi, the festival of colours, coloured powders and flowers are offered to the Lord Krishna. Pujas can be performed on a daily basis or only during festivals or exceptional occasions.

					Puja can be conducted by a priest or by the worshipper themself, and it can be done in a temple or at home. It is regarded as a very private and intimate ritual that enables the worshipper to meaningfully communicate with the divine.
					</p>
				<p>To sum up, puja is a crucial component of Hinduism that enables people to communicate with the divine and ask for blessings for their loved ones and themselves. Millions of Hindus around the world still rely heavily on this tradition, which has been handed down through the years.

				<h3>Meditation</h3>
				<img src="https://www.hinduwebsite.org/hinduism/images/meditating.jpg" width="300" height="200">
				<p>Hinduism has a long history of spiritual practise, and meditation is a crucial part of that tradition. It is regarded as a potent technique for developing inner tranquilly, improving mental acuity, and realising spirituality. The foundation of meditation is the idea that by calming the mind, one can communicate with the innately present divine awareness.
				</p>
				<p>Japa, one of the most popular meditation techniques in Hinduism, involves repeating a mantra or heavenly name. It is thought that repeating a mantra generates a strong vibration that helps to clear the mind and unite the practitioner with the divine. The mantras "Om" and "Hare Krishna," although there are many others that are also utilised, are the two that are used in Japa meditation the most frequently.

					In Japa meditation, the practitioner usually finds a calm spot, closes their eyes, and starts mentally repeating the mantra. The practitioner concentrates on the sound and vibration of the mantra as they repeat it, enabling it to fill their mind.
					</p>
				<p>In conclusion, meditation has been utilised for thousands of years in Hinduism as a technique of gaining spiritual development and self-realization. One of the most popular kinds of meditation in Hinduism is japa meditation, which is thought to produce a strong vibration that helps to cleanse the mind and link the practitioner with the divine. One can build inner calm, improve mental clarity, and communicate with their deeper selves by frequently engaging in Japa meditation.

				<p>Hinduism has a long history of using pilgrimage as a central component of its religion.

				<img src="https://manahotels.in/traveller/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ahilya_Ghat_by_the_Ganges_Varanasi1.jpg" width="300" height="200">
				<p>Varanasi, commonly referred to as Kashi or the City of Light, is one of the most important pilgrimage destinations in Hinduism. Varanasi, one of the oldest continuously inhabited towns in the world and thought to be the home of Lord Shiva, is situated on the banks of the revered Ganges River. Taking a bath in the Ganges is seen to be a purifying and cleansing experience. In addition, pilgrims visit the numerous temples and holy sites in Varanasi to perform rituals and give prayers.
				</p>
				<p>Because it is thought to have the ability to atone for sins and bestow benefits, the Ganges River itself is also a very important place of pilgrimage. Every year, millions of pilgrims visit the river to take baths, worship, and carry out rites in memory of their ancestors.
				</p>
				<img src="https://vikramroymehta.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/chardham-yatra.jpg?w=1200" width="300" height="200">
				<p>The Char Dham Yatra, which includes visits to Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath in the Himalayas, is another significant pilgrimage in Hinduism. These locations are regarded as the residences of numerous Hindu deities and are thought to be a source of blessings and spiritual power.
				</p>
				<p>In addition to being a tool to develop one's spiritual practise, pilgrimage plays a significant role in Hindu culture and tradition. It is a method to honour the numerous saints, sages, and deities who have influenced the development of the faith over thousands of years as well as to connect with its lengthy and historic history.
					In conclusion, pilgrimage is an integral part of Hinduism and offers a chance for enlightenment and a closer relationship with God. It is believed that going to holy places and temples is a good approach to strengthen one's faith and to obtain blessings and spiritual merit. Hinduism has several pilgrimage sites, which reflect the diversity and richness of the faith and provide a window into its incredibly long history.</p>

	<h2>Social Justice in Hinduism</h2>
	<p>Hinduism, a religion that has been influential in forming South Asia's cultural, social, and political landscape for thousands of years, places a high priority on social justice.</p>
	<p>Hinduism has a strong dedication to social justice and equality, which is reflected in its teachings on topics like caste, gender, and environmentalism.</p>
	<p>Hinduism's emphasis on the concept of dharma, or obligation, is one of its greatest contributions to social justice. According to Hindu philosophy, it is everyone's responsibility to play their individual role in society to the best of their abilities. This concept of duty encompasses all facets of life, such as social and environmental obligations.</p>
	<p>While the concept of social justice is not explicitly mentioned in the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad Gita, the Hindu scriptures do contain numerous references to the importance of social justice and the need to treat all people equally.</p>
	<p>For example, the Bhagavad Gita states that all people are equal in the eyes of God, and the Upanishads state that all people are equal in the eyes of the universe. The Hindu scriptures also emphasise the importance of treating all people with respect and dignity, regardless of their social status or economic background.</p>
	
	<section>
		<h3>Caste</h3>
		<img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cZUMhcs5Ij0/W7n2gQlkslI/AAAAAAAAK34/9vaHaQnR6wIZ8MZ5wK8OmR8wugMWEgCigCLcBGAs/s1600/Caste%2BSystem.jpg" width="300" height="200"> 
		<p>Caste, which has historically led to injustice and prejudice in South Asian civilizations, and Hinduism have a complicated relationship. Even though the caste system is not based on any particular religious theory, many Hindus have fought to oppose it because of how oppressive it is. Hindu reformers like Jyotirao Phule and B.R. Ambedkar were instrumental in the struggle against caste prejudice and the uplift of underprivileged groups.</p>
		<p>While the caste system is not a part of Hinduism, it is a part of Hindu culture. The caste system is a social hierarchy that divides people into four main groups: Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. The Brahmins are the highest caste, and they are considered to be the most intelligent and spiritually advanced. The Shudras are the lowest caste, and they are considered to be the least intelligent and spiritually advanced.</p>
		
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Gender Equality</h3>
		<p>Along with caste, Hinduism has contributed to the advancement of gender equality. Hindu teachings place a strong emphasis on the value of respect and equality for both men and women, notwithstanding the patriarchal nature of traditional Hindu culture. Hindu goddesses like Kali and Durga are potent representations of the strength and empowerment of women. From the Rani of Jhansi, who fought against British colonialism, to contemporary activist Vandana Shiva, who promotes women's rights and sustainable agriculture, Hindu women have also played significant roles in social justice movements.</p>
		
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Environmentalism</h3>
		<p>Hinduism has also contributed to the advancement of environmentalism. The Hindu scriptures contain numerous references to the importance of protecting the environment and preserving natural resources. The Vedas, for example, state that the earth is a sacred place that must be protected and respected. The Bhagavad Gita also states that the earth is a sacred place that must be protected and respected.</p>
		<p>Many Hindus have also been instrumental in the advancement of environmentalism. Mahatma Gandhi, for example, was a strong advocate for environmentalism and the preservation of natural resources.</p>
		<p>The interconnection of all living things and the importance of environmental preservation are stressed in Hindu teachings. Ahimsa, or non-violence, is a concept that includes not only people but also animals and the natural environment. Hindu teachings on environmental stewardship served as the foundation for the grassroots environmental movement known as the Chipko, which had its start in the 1970s and was spearheaded by women in rural Uttarakhand.</p>
