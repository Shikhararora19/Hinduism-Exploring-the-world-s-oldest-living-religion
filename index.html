			<h2>Hindu Philosophy</h2>
			<p>Hindu philosophy encompasses a vast and complex system of beliefs and practices that have evolved over thousands of years. At its core are three fundamental concepts: dharma, karma, and moksha.</p>
			
			<section id="dharma">
				<h3>Dharma</h3>
				<p>The term "dharma" refers to the moral and ethical standards that guide people's actions and behaviour. It entails obligations, commitments, and responsibilities that are dictated by one's social standing, gender, age, and other variables. Dharma is closely related to the idea of karma and is seen as the cornerstone of a just and peaceful society.</p>
				
				<p>There are four primary types of dharma: </p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Universal Dharma:</strong> The term "universal dharma" refers to the fundamental moral and ethical standards that hold true for everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic standing or place in society.</li>
					<li><strong>Human Dharma:</strong> This refers to the obligations and duties that are unique to humans, such as taking care of one's family and giving back to the community.</li>
					<li><strong>Caste Dharma:</strong> This refers to the obligations set forth by conventional Hindu society that are particular to one's caste or social standing.</li>
					<li><strong>Individual Dharma:</strong> This refers to the responsibilities and obligations that are particular to the person, depending on their circumstances, preferences, and aspirations.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			
			<section id="karma">
				<h3>Karma</h3>
				<p>Karma refers to the principle that every action has a reaction, or the law of cause and effect. It is predicated on the idea that one's present situation is a direct outcome of past choices, and that one's future is determined by the choices they make today. Karma is a concept of reward and punishment as well as a means of spiritual and personal development.</p>
				
				<p>There are three types of karma: </p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Sanchita Karma:</strong>  This is the accumulated, unfinished karma from previous incarnations.</li>
					<li><strong>Prarabdha Karma:</strong> Prarabdha Karma is the percentage of sanchita Karma that is assigned to this particular life and that one must undergo in order to be satisfied.</li>
					<li><strong>Kriyamana Karma:</strong> This refers to the karma that one generates right now and will have an impact on experiences in the future.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			
			<section id="moksha">
				<h3>Moksha</h3>
				<p>Moksha, which means being freed from the cycle of birth and death (samsara) and achieving permanent happiness and consciousness, is the ultimate aim of Hinduism. (moksha). Realizing one's inner self (atman) and uniting the individual soul with the universal soul are necessary for achieving it. (brahman). Yoga, meditation, and bhakti are a few of the spiritual disciplines that pave the way to moksha.</p>
				
				<p>There are four main paths to moksha, known as the four yogas: </p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Jnana Yoga:</strong> Jnana Yoga is the practise of seeking knowledge and understanding in order to recognise one's true identity and the interconnectedness of all things.</li>
					<li><strong>Bhakti Yoga:</strong> This is the name for the path of love and devotion, which entails developing a close, intimate bond with a god or guru.</li>
					<li><strong>Karma Yoga:</strong> This is the way of selfless activity and service, which entails carrying out tasks without regard for the outcomes or one's own benefit.</li>
					<li><strong>Raja Yoga:</strong> This is a term used to describe the path of meditation and self-discipline that entails mind and sense control in order to reach higher realms of awareness.</li>
					</ol>
